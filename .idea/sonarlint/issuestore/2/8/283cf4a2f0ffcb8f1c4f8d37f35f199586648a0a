╔typescript:S1874"Д'throwError' is deprecated. Support for passing an error value will be removed in v8. Instead, pass a factory function to `throwError(() => new Error('test'))`. This is
because it will create the error at the moment it should be created and capture a more appropriate stack trace. If
for some reason you need to create the error ahead of time, you can still do that: `const err = new Error('test'); throwError(() => err);`.(▓ктн■    
