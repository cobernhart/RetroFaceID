# RetroFaceID: Face Recognition in Historical Image Archives
Intra-Class Variations
While deep learning based face recognition surpasses human performance in constrained settings, it still struggles to achieve similar results applied in completely unconstrained settings. 
This bachelor thesis explores the effectiveness of state-of-the-art face recognition models in the specific case of identifying actors in a historical photography collection of the Theatre Museum Vienna. Actors can be pictured at different angles and poses, at a different age, with masks and costumes leading to strong intra-class variations.
In addition, images might show signs of decay due to their historical nature, further increasing the difficulty for a face recognition model to make correct predictions. 
This bachelor thesis shows that ElasticFace, a face recognition model trained using a novel learning loss strategy, achieves 79.6\% accuracy on the museum's photo database. Based on those outcomes, deploying face recognition to analyse historical image collections delivers valuable results for historians. To make this state-of-the-art technology accessible a tool is developed in cooperation with the Theatre Museum Vienna.
